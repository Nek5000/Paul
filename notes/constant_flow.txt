Here is a typical output for the constant flow-rate case,

14750  Volflow X  1.4710E+01   1.4826E-01   2.4241E-09   3.0000E-03   3.0000E-03  

which can be found in the logfile. The entries in each column are defined below.

col 1:  step number
col 2:  keyword
col 3:  direction of periodicity
col 4:  time of simulation (i.e., t=14.71)
col 5:  effective pressure drop at this time 
        (assuming ffx=0, else, drop = ffx + col 5)
col 6:  target flow rate - current rate, prior to correction.
col 7:  current flow rate, prior to correction.
col 8:  flow rate, after correction.

A typical usage is:

grep volflow logfile > t.v 

to collect the time history of these parameters.

You can plot pressure drop vs. time via gnuplot:

gnuplot
>> plot 't.v' u 4:5 w l

etc.

NOTE: there may need to be a scale factor associated with density, rho. 
I always use rho=1, in which case no scale factor is required.
